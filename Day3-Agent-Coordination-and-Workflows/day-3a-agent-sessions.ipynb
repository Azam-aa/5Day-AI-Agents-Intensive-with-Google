I can try to provide more specific details if you have a focus!\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas for AI in healthcare right now. Here are some of the latest developments and trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Designing from Scratch:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of screening existing libraries, generative AI models (like those based on GANs or diffusion models) can now design entirely new molecules with specific desired properties. This means they can create compounds that have never been seen before but are predicted to be effective against a target disease.\n*   **Optimizing Existing Molecules:** AI can also take a promising but imperfect molecule and suggest modifications to improve its potency, reduce toxicity, or enhance its pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes it).\n*   **Examples:** Companies are announcing successes in designing novel drug candidates for conditions like cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders using these generative approaches.\n\n**2. Accelerating Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Leveraging Multi-Omics Data:** AI excels at integrating and analyzing massive, complex datasets, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. This allows researchers to identify novel biological targets (like specific proteins or pathways) that are implicated in disease more effectively than traditional methods.\n*   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** By analyzing these multi-omics datasets, AI can help unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases, revealing new points of intervention for drug development.\n\n**3. Enhancing Pre-clinical Research:**\n\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are getting better at predicting how a drug candidate will behave in biological systems *before* it's tested in animals or humans. This includes predicting its likely efficacy against a disease and its potential toxic side effects.\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can rapidly screen vast virtual libraries of compounds against a target, identifying promising candidates much faster and cheaper than traditional high-throughput screening.\n*   **Optimizing Experimental Design:** AI can even help design more efficient and informative pre-clinical experiments, reducing the number of experiments needed and generating higher quality data.\n\n**4. Streamlining Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can identify specific patient subgroups who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more successful clinical trials and the development of personalized medicines.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models can analyze early clinical trial data to predict the likelihood of success, allowing for earlier decision-making and resource allocation.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can help discover new biomarkers that can be used to monitor drug efficacy and patient response during clinical trials.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze vast amounts of data, including scientific literature, clinical trial data, and real-world evidence, to identify existing drugs that might be effective for new indications. This is a faster and often cheaper route to drug development.\n\n**Companies and Research Highlights:**\n\nMany companies are at the forefront of this revolution. You'll often see news about:\n\n*   **AI-native drug discovery companies:** Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **Atomwise**, **Exscientia**, **BenevolentAI**, and **Schrödinger** are built around AI platforms for drug discovery and have announced significant partnerships and pipeline advancements.\n*   **Big Pharma collaborations:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI drug discovery firms to integrate these capabilities into their own R&D pipelines.\n*   **Breakthroughs in specific disease areas:** News often highlights AI-driven successes in areas like Alzheimer's, cancer, rare genetic diseases, and anti-infectives.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite the rapid progress, challenges still exist:\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation.\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** The effectiveness of AI models is heavily dependent on the quality and availability of biological and chemical data.\n*   **Regulatory Pathways:** Navigating regulatory approval for AI-discovered drugs is an evolving process.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a particular prediction can sometimes be challenging, especially with complex deep learning models.\n\nOverall, AI is fundamentally changing the landscape of drug discovery, making it faster, more efficient, and opening up possibilities for developing novel therapies that were previously unimaginable.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Okay, let's dive deeper into the second development I mentioned: **Accelerating Target Identification**.\n\nThis is a crucial early step in drug discovery. Before you can even think about designing a drug, you need to know *what* you're trying to target to treat a disease. This often means identifying a specific **biological target** – usually a protein or a gene – that plays a critical role in the disease process. If you can modulate the activity of this target (e.g., inhibit an overactive enzyme or activate a deficient receptor), you might be able to alleviate the disease.\n\nHere's how AI is revolutionizing this process:\n\n**1. Integrating Multi-Omics Data:**\n\n*   **What is Multi-Omics?** Traditionally, researchers might look at genetic data (genomics) or protein data (proteomics) separately. Multi-omics takes this much further by integrating data from multiple biological \"layers\" simultaneously. This includes:\n    *   **Genomics:** The complete set of genes.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** Which genes are being \"expressed\" (turned into RNA) and at what levels.\n    *   **Proteomics:** The complete set of proteins and their modifications.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** The complete set of small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes.\n    *   **Epigenomics:** Modifications to DNA that affect gene activity without changing the DNA sequence itself.\n*   **The Challenge for Humans:** These datasets are incredibly vast, complex, and noisy. A single experiment can generate terabytes of data. Manually sifting through this to find meaningful patterns and connections is incredibly difficult, if not impossible.\n*   **AI's Superpower:** AI, particularly machine learning algorithms, excels at:\n    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying subtle correlations and patterns across these diverse datasets that human eyes would miss.\n    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Simplifying high-dimensional data (data with many variables) into lower dimensions while retaining the most important information.\n    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Spotting outliers that might represent key disease drivers.\n    *   **Network Analysis:** Building complex biological networks and understanding how different molecules interact and influence each other.\n\n**2. Unraveling Complex Disease Mechanisms:**\n\n*   **Beyond Single Genes:** Many diseases, especially complex ones like cancer, Alzheimer's, or autoimmune disorders, aren't caused by a single faulty gene. They arise from a complex interplay of multiple genetic, cellular, and environmental factors.\n*   **AI for Systems Biology:** AI can help researchers build \"systems biology\" models – comprehensive pictures of how biological systems function. By analyzing multi-omics data, AI can map out the entire cascade of events that leads to disease, from initial genetic mutations to cellular dysfunction.\n*   **Identifying Key Nodes:** Within these complex networks, AI can pinpoint critical \"nodes\" or molecules that are disproportionately important to the disease process. These nodes are prime candidates for drug targets. For example, AI might identify a protein that is upregulated in a disease state and is a hub for many other disease-related pathways.\n\n**3. Examples and Applications:**\n\n*   **Rare Diseases:** For rare diseases, where patient populations are small and understanding is limited, AI can analyze the genomic and clinical data of affected individuals to identify common underlying biological defects and potential targets.\n*   **Oncology:** AI is being used to identify targets for new cancer therapies by analyzing tumor genomics, identifying mutations that drive cancer growth, and predicting which cellular pathways are essential for cancer cell survival.\n*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** By integrating brain imaging, genetic, and clinical data, AI can help identify targets related to protein aggregation, inflammation, or neuronal death in diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\n\n**In essence, AI-driven target identification is like having an incredibly powerful microscope and detective combined.** It allows researchers to:\n\n*   **See connections** that were previously hidden.\n*   **Uncover the root causes** of diseases more effectively.\n*   **Identify the most promising points of intervention** for developing new drugs, saving time and resources in the long run.\n\nThis development is foundational because a poorly chosen target can lead to years of wasted research and development, even if the subsequent drug design and testing are flawless. AI is dramatically improving the chances of selecting the *right* targets from the outset.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're right to ask about the companies!

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
