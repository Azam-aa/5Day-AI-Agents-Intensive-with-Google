Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

Sounds like science fiction? It's not. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are no longer a niche academic concept; they are a powerful paradigm offering tangible benefits to software developers looking to build more robust, intelligent, and efficient applications. Let's dive into why you should be paying attention.\n\n---\n\n### Section 1: Enhanced Problem Decomposition and Modularity\n\n*   **Breaking Down Complexity:** MAS allows for the natural decomposition of large, intricate problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, each handled by an independent agent. This significantly simplifies development and maintenance.\n*   **Independent Development & Testing:** Each agent can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, accelerating development cycles and reducing the risk of cascading failures.\n*   **Reusability and Interoperability:** Well-defined agents with clear communication protocols can be easily reused across different projects or integrated with existing systems, fostering a more modular and adaptable software ecosystem.\n\n### Section 2: Increased Robustness and Resilience\n\n*   **Decentralized Control:** Unlike monolithic systems, MAS often operate with decentralized control. If one agent fails, the system can often continue to function, gracefully degrading or rerouting tasks to other agents.\n*   **Fault Tolerance and Self-Healing:** Agents can be designed to detect failures in their peers and initiate recovery processes, leading to highly fault-tolerant and even self-healing systems.\n*   **Adaptability to Dynamic Environments:** MAS excels in environments where conditions change frequently. Agents can react to new information and adjust their behavior, making the overall system more adaptable and resilient to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n### Section 3: Sophisticated Collaboration and Intelligence\n\n*   **Emergent Behavior:** The interaction and collaboration between multiple agents can lead to emergent behaviors and solutions that are far more sophisticated than what any single agent could achieve alone.\n*   **Distributed Decision-Making:** Complex decisions can be made collaboratively by multiple agents, leveraging their individual expertise and perspectives for more informed and optimized outcomes.\n*   **Learning and Adaptation at Scale:** MAS provides a natural framework for distributed machine learning, where individual agents can learn from their experiences and share knowledge, leading to a system that continuously improves its performance over time.\n\n### Section 4: New Avenues for Innovation and Application\n\n*   **Simulating Complex Real-World Scenarios:** MAS is ideal for modeling and simulating complex systems like supply chains, traffic control, or ecological interactions, opening doors for predictive analytics and optimization.\n*   **Intelligent Automation and Robotics:** From smart grids to autonomous vehicles, MAS is the backbone of many advanced automation and robotics applications requiring coordination and intelligent interaction.\n*   **Enhanced User Experiences:** Imagine personalized assistants that collaborate to fulfill your needs, or adaptive user interfaces that tailor themselves to your behavior – MAS can power next-generation, intuitive user experiences.\n\n---\n\n**Concluding Thought:** Embracing multi-agent systems isn't just about adopting a new technology; it's about adopting a new way of thinking about software design and development. By leveraging the power of decentralized intelligence, collaboration, and modularity, you can build software that is not only more powerful and resilient but also more adaptable to the ever-evolving challenges of the digital world.

What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`.

Consider adding a specific thought or feeling that reflects his long solitude. Does he feel a flicker of excitement for adventure, a pang of fear at the unknown, or perhaps a deep, almost forgotten longing? Showing his inner world will make him a more relatable character.\n*   **Sensory Details & World-Building:** The description of the map is good, particularly the \"treated kelp\" and \"eerie, internal light.\" To further immerse the reader, you could expand on the map's strangeness. What do the \"serpentine lines\" look like beyond just being lines? Are they textured? Do they shift slightly? Does the emerald star emit any sound or warmth? These details can enhance the mystery and make the discovery more impactful.\n*   **Plot Hook Clarity:** The discovery is intriguing, but the \"plot\" is currently just the discovery itself. To propel the narrative forward, consider hinting at *why* this map might have been hidden or *what* the emerald star might represent. Is it a treasure? A warning? A gateway? A brief internal thought from Elias about the *possibility* of what the map could lead to would create a stronger hook for what comes next.\nRefinerAgent > The salt spray was Elias’s constant companion, misting his beard and clinging to the worn stone of the lighthouse.
