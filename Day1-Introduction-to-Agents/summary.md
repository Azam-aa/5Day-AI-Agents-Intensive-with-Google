# 🧠 Day 1 – Introduction to Agents

This folder contains my notes, summaries, and code from **Day 1** of the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive with Google**.  
The focus of Day 1 is understanding what AI Agents are, how they work, and how they evolve from traditional predictive models into **autonomous problem-solving systems**.

## 📘 Summary

This whitepaper introduces AI Agents — intelligent systems that combine **reasoning models**, **tools**, and an **orchestration layer** to perform tasks independently.  
Agents are the next step in the evolution of AI: they don’t just predict or generate, they **plan, act, and learn**.

### Key Ideas from the Whitepaper:
1. **Core Agent Architecture**
   - **Model (Brain):** The reasoning engine that processes information and makes decisions.  
   - **Tools (Hands):** APIs, databases, or code functions that let the agent act in the real world.  
   - **Orchestration Layer (Nervous System):** Manages planning, memory, and execution loops.
   - Together, they form a continuous “**Think → Act → Observe**” cycle.

2. **Agentic Problem-Solving Loop**
   1. Get the mission  
   2. Scan the scene (collect context)  
   3. Think it through (plan)  
   4. Take action  
   5. Observe and iterate  
   → This cycle continues until the goal is achieved.

3. **Taxonomy of Agents (Levels 0–4)**
   - **Level 0:** Core Reasoning (model-only)  
   - **Level 1:** Connected Problem Solver (uses tools & APIs)  
   - **Level 2:** Strategic Problem Solver (plans multi-step goals)  
   - **Level 3:** Collaborative Multi-Agent System (team of agents)  
   - **Level 4:** Self-Evolving System (creates tools/agents dynamically)

4. **AgentOps & Security**
   - Introduces **AgentOps**, an evolved form of DevOps/MLOps for agent reliability and debugging.  
   - Focuses on **Reasoning-based defenses**, **Agent identity**, and **Governance** to prevent misuse or “agent sprawl”.

5. **Agent Interoperability**
   - **Agents & Humans:** Use multimodal communication and live mode (speech, vision).  
   - **Agents & Agents (A2A):** Use the **Agent2Agent protocol** for collaboration.  
   - **Agents & Money:** Use secure transaction standards like **AP2** and **x402**.

## 💡 What I Learned (In My Words)

- Agents are like **digital teammates**, not tools — they can reason, act, and learn.  
- The “brain-hands-nervous system” architecture is simple but powerful.  
- Every good agent needs **context, tools, and memory** — not just a large model.  
- **AgentOps** is essential for debugging and scaling AI agents like real software systems.  
- The future is **multi-agent collaboration**, where specialized agents work like human teams.

## 🧩 Codelabs Completed

1. **[Day 1a – From Prompt to Action](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-1a-from-prompt-to-action)**  
   → Built my first AI Agent using **Gemini API** and **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.  
   → Tested API integration and “Think–Act–Observe” cycle.

2. **[Day 1b – Multi-Agent Architectures](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-1b-agent-architectures)**  
   → Created a simple **multi-agent system** (manager + worker agents).  
   → Explored communication between agents using tasks and messages.

## 🧠 Reflection

Today made me realize that **agents are not just AI models — they’re small intelligent ecosystems.**  
Each part (Model, Tools, Orchestrator) plays a distinct role, and the system is only as strong as its orchestration.  
The idea of **AgentOps** — treating agents like real software with testing, logging, and monitoring — feels like the future of backend AI systems.
